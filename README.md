📚 Book Management Application
Tech Stack: Core Java, JDBC, Servlets, JSP, HTML, CSS, MySQL, Apache Tomcat

🔹 Project Overview
The Book Management Application is a full-stack Java web application designed to streamline the management of book records in a database. It uses Java Servlets for backend logic, JDBC for database connectivity, and JSP/HTML/CSS for the frontend, all deployed on an Apache Tomcat server.

🎯 Key Features
Add New Book
Enter title, author, and price to store a new book in the MySQL database.

View Book List
Displays all books in a dynamic HTML table fetched from the database.

Delete Book
(Can be added optionally) Remove specific book entries based on their ID.

Data Persistence
All data is stored and retrieved from a MySQL database using JDBC.

Servlet + JSP Integration
The application uses the MVC pattern to separate the business logic from presentation.

🧩 Modules
Model:
Book.java — Represents the book entity with fields like id, title, author, price.

DAO (Data Access Object):
BookDAO.java — Handles all database operations (CRUD) using JDBC.

Servlet:
BookServlet.java — Handles client requests, interacts with DAO, and dispatches to JSPs.

Views (Frontend):

index.html — Form to input new books.

booklist.jsp — Displays the list of all books from the database.

🧪 Tools & Technologies
IDE: Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA

Server: Apache Tomcat

Database: MySQL

Languages: Java, HTML, CSS

Libraries: MySQL JDBC Connector

🚀 Deployment & Usage
Run on Apache Tomcat (localhost:8080/BookManagementApp)

Access index.html to add books

View booklist.jsp for all entries

Database reflects real-time changes

✅ Learning Outcomes
Practical implementation of Servlets, JSP, and JDBC

Hands-on experience with MVC architecture

Understanding of Java web app deployment

Real-world usage of CRUD operations with MySQL

📚✨ Book Management Application
A full-stack Java web app for seamless book cataloging and management.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Java (Core) • JDBC • Servlets • JSP • HTML/CSS • MySQL • Apache Tomcat

🌟 Project Summary
The Book Management Application is a dynamic, database-driven web solution built with Java EE technologies, designed to manage books efficiently. With real-time CRUD operations and a responsive UI, this project demonstrates how front-end and back-end components interact seamlessly in a traditional Java web architecture. 📘🖥️

It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, ensuring maintainability and separation of concerns.

✨ Core Features
🔹 Add New Books
Easily enter book details (Title, Author, Price) through a clean, user-friendly HTML form.

🔹 View Book Catalog
Fetch and display all book records dynamically from the MySQL database in a well-structured table using JSP.

🔹 Database Integration
All entries are persisted in a MySQL database using JDBC, ensuring data integrity.

🔹 Modular Design
Backend logic handled via Servlets, database via DAO, and presentation with JSP + CSS.

🔹 CRUD Ready
Project is scalable with full CRUD functionality (create, read, update, delete) — with update/delete available as extensions.
